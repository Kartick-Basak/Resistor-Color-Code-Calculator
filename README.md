## [Resistor Color Code Calculator](https://kartick-basak.github.io/Resistor-Color-Code-Calculator/)
This is a simple and interactive web application for calculating the *resistance, tolerance, and temperature coefficient* of a resistor based on its color bands. The calculator supports both **4-band and 5-band resistors** and provides a visual representation of the selected colors.

## Features
- üö• **Interactive Interface:** Select colors from dropdown menus to instantly see the calculated values.

- üëÄ **Visual Feedback:** The on-screen resistor visually updates to match your selected color bands.

- ‚ö°Ô∏è **Supports 4 and 5-band resistors:** Automatically adjusts the calculation based on whether you select a color for the 5th band.

- üìÄ **Responsive Design:** Optimized to work on both desktop and mobile devices.

- ü´ß **Lightweight:** Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Setup
In this application, I have used HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## How It Works
The application relies on the following logic:

- **HTML (index.html):** Defines the structure of the page, including the resistor visualizer, the color selection dropdowns, and the output fields.

- **CSS (style.css):** Contains custom styles to visually represent the resistor and its color bands.

- **JavaScript (script.js):**
    - Stores the numerical, multiplier, tolerance, and temperature coefficient values for each color.

    - Listens for changes on any of the color selection dropdowns.

    - When a change occurs, it reads the selected colors and performs the calculation.

    - It determines if the resistor is a 4-band or 5-band type based on the 5th band selection.

    - The final calculated resistance, tolerance, and temperature coefficient are then displayed on the page.
